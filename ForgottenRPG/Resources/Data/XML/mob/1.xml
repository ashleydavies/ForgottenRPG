                Farmer Joe glances in your direction, looking at you with uncertainty. From his expression of worry you feel he distrusts you. [N] [N] 'Ah, I knew you would come eventually.' He sighs under his breath, 'Do you require the package?'

                'Oh... I'm sorry. I mistook you for someone else.' He looks worried, as if he has told you a great secret. 'I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to leave: This is, after all, private land.'

            <Node id="2">
                He looks scared, but whatever he is trying to protect is enough to make him crazy enough to try to fight you. It must be very important: 'Then I shall fight you for my lands.'

            <Node id="3">
                'Thank you.' A sense of relief passes across his face. He must be protecting something very important, strange for an unaugmented human.

                He looks relieved about you having plans to leave, however does not reply, probably worried about how you could respond.

                'Who do you think you're tricking! You don't even have 30 coins! Get off my land right now or I'll be forced to fight you!'

                He takes your money from a considerable distance, stretching towards you. He quietly slides them into his pocket and looks in your direction with distaste. [N] [N] 'So? What do you want now? Clear off!'
            </Node>
            <Node id="7">
                He, already annoyed at your presence and lying about giving him money, is more annoyed about your laid back attitude to the situation. [N] [N] '... I gave you a chance...' He jumps forward with his spear in hand.

                You manage to calm him down by changing your tone of voice slightly. 'Sorry for being so aggressive, but I really do need you to leave my land now'
