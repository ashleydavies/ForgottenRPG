# ShaRPG
ShaRPG, or Sharp RPG, is an excellent example of bad puns, and a total re-write of my [unfinished] Java RPG engine, but in C#.

It is not compatible with the data, as many of the XML formats have changed.

It runs a simple 'bytecode' (integer array) VM as a scripting language, with a rudimentary ASM-style language and a small compiler to morph that into acceptable code.

# Warning
The default branch of the repository is on develop, since there is no stable release.
